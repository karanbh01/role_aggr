About Jupiter

Jupiter is one of the UK’s leading investment management companies with over 500 employees and £51.3 billion worth of assets under management (as at 30th June 2024).

Jupiter provides investment services to individual and institutional investors through mutual funds (UK unit trusts, Luxembourg SICAVs and Dublin OEICs), separately managed accounts and sub-advised funds. Jupiter has experienced a period of international growth with offices open in EMEA and APAC.

The majority of our employees are based in our London office located just minutes from Victoria station which provides stair-free access from both the Underground’s Victoria line and National Rail platforms, as well as limited road crossings to the Jupiter office. Our London office was designed to encourage employees to live active, healthy lives with floor-to-ceiling windows that allow for greater natural light and the benefit of a private balcony, table tennis room, cycle storage and on-site shower and locker facilities. The short distance to Green Park and St James' Park also provides employees with a natural space to relax during their lunch break and a healthy alternative to office-based meetings. 

We offer our UK employees a 3:2 hybrid working arrangement where Tuesdays, Thursdays and a third day of your choice are worked from the office. The other two days may be worked from home.  This facilitates collaboration and allows employees to maximise productivity whilst maintaining a healthy work/life balance.

Financial Process Implementation & Collaboration

Ensure all governance and financial processes are policy-driven and align with recognised best practice standards.

Champion consistent use of project and portfolio reporting templates and tools.

Reporting & Committee Support

Produce accurate, timely reporting packs for senior stakeholders, including the Operating Committee.

Ensure reporting includes insightful summaries, risk/dependency views, and clear action plans for Amber/Red initiatives.

Provide visibility and traceability across the Change portfolio, helping inform strategic decisions.

PMO Operations & Continuous Improvement

Act as a central coordination point for portfolio delivery alignment.

Support broader PMO responsibilities including documentation, process improvement, and administrative oversight.

Capture lessons learned and contribute to the ongoing maturity of PMO practices.

What a Successful PMO Analyst Looks Like

The successful PMO Analyst will contribute to a Change PMO that:

Aligns Change with Strategy – Ensuring initiatives are prioritised and governed in line with strategic objectives.

Supports Effective Delivery – Providing frameworks and tools that underpin, rather than constrain, successful delivery.

Enables Governance & Assurance – Embedding proportionate control and risk management across all initiatives.

Drives Resource and Portfolio Management – Offering a clear view of demand, capacity, and portfolio balance.

Promotes Continuous Improvement – Encouraging evolution of process and delivery based on insight and reflection.

Is firmly Delivery-Minded – Understanding that governance and oversight should enable, not obstruct, the execution of change.

We offer our UK employees a 3:2 hybrid working arrangement where Tuesdays, Thursdays and a third day of your choice are worked from the office. The other two days may be worked from home.  This facilitates collaboration and allows employees to maximise productivity whilst maintaining a healthy work/life balance.

Job Description:
We are currently seeking a dynamic Product Manager for our Private Wealth Technology team who has a strong passion for building new products and democratizing data for non-technical users. As a member of the Private Wealth Technology team, you’ll be expected to solve real business challenges by bridging strategy and technology execution – owning complex initiatives from inception to delivery. You are equal parts problem solver and operator with an instinct for identifying what matters, an a bias for action- oriented mindset, and the resilience to see things through. 


Responsibilities:

Own Business Problem-Solving: Navigate ambiguity to define, structure, and deliver strategic technology initiatives across Private Wealth. Act as the first responder to business needs—whether it’s a data gap, process friction, or new insight required.

Translate Needs into Execution: Partner with investment professionals, developers, and stakeholders to document and triage requests across CRM, reporting, data, and workflow systems. Define MVPs, prioritize backlogs, and ensure delivery timelines are met.

Drive Product and Data Strategy: Lead intake and refinement of technology and data asks related to sales tracking, client engagement, and business analytics. Proactively identify opportunities for better tooling, automation, or data flows that increase adoption and reduce manual work.

Be the ‘Super Connector’: Coordinate across functional business and technology areas—Sales, Marketing, Operations, and Technology—to ensure we deliver complete solutions, not isolated features. Push for integration, not just implementation.

Enable Better Decision-Making: Maintain critical data tables that power downstream reporting and insights. Support the delivery of clear, accurate analytics to enable senior leadership to make faster, smarter decisions.

Institutionalize Process & Governance: Partner with global and regional teams to document recurring issues and propose solutions. Champion sustainable ways of working—across intake, prioritization, delivery, and documentation.

Detail Oriented – you have experience recording detailed requirements or design documents and are comfortable documenting end-to-end functional, technical, reporting, and data needs

Flexible - You want to work in a fast-paced environment requiring you to flex between analytical, strategic, and operational aspects of the job.  Regardless of the need, you’re happy to roll up your sleeves to get any job done.

Independent - You can work effectively as an individual contributor and possess strong analytical, problem solving, critical thinking, and decision-making skills, multitask and deliver under tight deadlines

The Director of Technical Digital Product - Communications & Digital Engagement, is purposed to help transform RBC Insurance digital technologies from the outside in.  Utilizing a deep understanding of financial market technology, and a keen sense of future state technical architecture, the ideal candidate will be able to not only understand existing RBC Insurance Infrastructure, but also be able to advocate for target state systems and architecture across our digital product suite.  

Today, messaging to clients and advisors—whether compliance notifications, marketing campaigns, document transmissions, or system alerts—is siloed across teams and technologies.

4. Integrate Consent, Preferences & Suppression Logic:

Govern the ingestion and enforcement of client and advisor communication preferences across all systems.

Integrate with privacy teams and CDP to enable suppression, opt-in/opt-out tracking, and data residency compliance.

5. Implement Scalable Access & Permissions Governance:

Build role-based access models tied to enterprise identity systems, ensuring proper access to compose, approve, or publish communications.

Establish platform-specific permission schemas (e.g., SFMC user roles, Salesforce record types etc.).

6. Create a Unified Intake, Triage & SLA Model:

Develop clear intake and prioritization workflows for communication and document requests from business units.

Set up KPIs, turnaround times, and operational playbooks to manage demand.

7. Operationalize Communication Monitoring & Incident Response:

Establish real-time monitoring of outbound communications with failure detection, audit logging, and alerting.

Design an incident response framework for high-risk or incorrect communications.

8. Build Analytics & Optimization Capabilities:

Partner with analytics teams to develop dashboards and performance scorecards across communication channels.

Implement A/B testing capabilities and data-driven optimization loops.

9. Ensure End-to-End Documentation & Knowledge Sharing:

Develop and maintain documentation of communication logic, ownership, templates, and data flows.

Robeco is an active sustainable investor and a committed signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment since 2006. Robeco has a long-standing history in sustainable investing and is committed to drive positive change through being at the forefront in stewardship and its focus on ESG integration.

Department

The Active Ownership team is responsible for voting at annual meetings and actively engages in dialogues about environmental, social, and corporate governance topics with listed companies. The Active Ownership team fulfills a fundamental role in Robeco’s sustainability proposition and uses its resources to contribute to both investment results and to create societal impact; the Active Ownership team has a role to boost Robeco’s strategy on sustainable investing throughout the firm and associate Robeco with this externally. The team is also involved in Robeco’s exclusion policy. The team reports on all these activities internally and externally.

Position & Requirements

The Active Ownership Analyst works closely together with the team’s other Analysts, Engagement Specialists, and Investment teams in active dialogue cases.

The Active Ownership Analyst will be jointly responsible for the proxy voting process. Annually Robeco votes its shares at approximately 7,000 company meetings. Voting recommendations are insourced and customized to Robeco’s own voting policy. The analyst will be responsible for implementing Robeco’s voting policy, analyzing and deciding on how to vote on priority shareholder meetings. The proxy voting process is complex, requires systematic and accurate administrative execution and involves internal consultation within the team and with portfolio managers and analysts within Robeco. Due to the increasing number of shareholder meetings, increased client request for customization, process management skills are important. The workload increases during the voting season, which runs from March to June.

Outside the voting season, proxy voting takes less time, and the Active Ownership Analyst will join the Engagement Specialists in conducting the active dialogue with international companies. Robeco conducts active dialogues, often theme based, with international companies typically lasting for two to three years. The aim of these dialogues is to improve the long-term risk return profile and the sustainable behavior of these companies, in which Robeco’s clients hold investments. Also, the Active Ownership Analyst will be involved in projects for the team, often in close collaboration with one of the Engagement Specialists. Reporting on voting and on engagement is part of the function. Additionally, the Active Ownership Analyst is expected to play a key role in improving the proxy voting process in terms of efficiency and policy implementation. The Active Ownership Analyst will support the team in its working process and will be involved in various audits on those processes.
